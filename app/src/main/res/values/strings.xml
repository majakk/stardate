    This mobile application provides an accurate stardate according to STArchive (and Google Calendar).
    By this widely accepted theory stardates actually begin on 2162-01-04 ([0]0000.0) and advances at a rate of 5 units per day.
    \n
    Stardates are universal in the sense that they can be correlated to GMT. At the same time they are subject to general relativity theory.
    The number in square brackets (e.g. [-27]) is the issue number. The negative sign indicate that we are 27 issues before Stardate zero
    which according to STArchive might be related to the incorporation of the Federation and discovery of the warp drive. The middle section of the number
    commonly written as e.g. SD 00712.8 is the most common way to annotate Stardates. The last two digits are for precision and the last digit updates
    at a rate of about once every twenty second.
